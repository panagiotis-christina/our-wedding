                            <p>This was WordPress website, converted in HTML. Τhe site was redesigned and presented in a more attractive and modern way. Because this particular site had a lot of content, the challenge that had to be addressed was the conversion of WordPress to PHP, as well as transferring the content and images to the correct paths so usability would remain the same.

                            <p>This is a website that I designed and implemented following the customer's instructions. In this project, there are seminars that are held on specific days, as presented in the calendar, with a maximum capacity. Thus, people who want to participate in a seminar have to fill in a form, and when the maximum number of people is reached, the form closes.</p>
